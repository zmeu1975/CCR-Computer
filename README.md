# CCR-Computer
Computer for Closed Circuit Rebreather

This is my first attempt at coding for Arduino based hardware and using Github. 

CCR rebreathers are inherently dangerous through both missuse and mechanical failier.
With this project I hope to address some of those issues to make this enjoyable 
past time just a little safer.
